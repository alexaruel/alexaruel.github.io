## About

I am a Post-doctoral Researcher at the Cognitive Mechanisms of Learning and Change [Schuck Lab](https://schucklab.gitlab.io/) at the [University of Hamburg, Germany](https://www.uni-hamburg.de/en.html).

My main research interests include **understanding the mechanisms that support learning and decision-making and how these abilities change during aging**. I use techniques such as EEG and fMRI in combination with behavioral measurements and computational modeling.

I completed my Masters and PhD at [Concordia University in Montreal, Canada](https://www.concordia.ca/).

Outside the lab, you will find me at the yoga studio, cycling around the city, watercolor painting or at a cafe with a good book and the perfect latte.

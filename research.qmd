### Decision-Making Strategy Changes during Healthy Aging

What strategies do older adults engage in during decision-making?\
Current work (including my own!) suggests that older adults rely primarily on model-free strategies due to their [marked deficits in model-based learning](https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article-abstract/33/5/1768/6576312?redirectedFrom=PDF&casa_token=hMQp3yhn6RUAAAAA:VJinCJMZT-hjvyZ3eszgS-512__QdpCygyo5yYtdrclQGVQzHXipvEib1DMfMNvoMPioag5Rbwc3ruEU). However, in the last decade younger adults have been shown to engage in other, intermediate, strategies such as [Successor Representation learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0180-8). To date, it remains unknown if older adults also engage in Successor Representation learning. The current project aims to answer this question by using behavioral analyses and computational modeling. Imaging techniques will also be used to investigate if this ability is related to [neural replay](https://web.archive.org/web/20220527093658id_/https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2022/02/02/2022.02.02.478787.full.pdf).

This project is in collaboration with [Sukran Karaosmanoglu](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/hci/people/karaosmanoglu.html), a senior PhD student in the Informatics Department at the University of Hamburg.

### Credit Assignment abilities in Aging Adults

Decision-making often involves changes in stimulus & reward contingencies (e.g. a previously unrewarded choice is now rewarded). In these cases, we have to be able to link specific choices or actions to their outcomes. This is analogous to thinking: "What choice did I make in order to get this reward?" and subsequently increasing the value of choosing that same choice option in the future. This process is referred to as [credit assignment](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08662-8.pdf).\
Accurate credit assignment depends on the representation of the task (i.e, cognitive map of the environment). Without such a representation individuals are unable to causally attribute reward feedback.\
In the current project, we aim to understand if older adults, once taught the representation of the task, successfuly engage in credit assignment.

This project is in collaboration with [Dr. Xiangjuan Ren (University of Hamburg)](https://www.psy.uni-hamburg.de/arbeitsbereiche/kognitive-neurowissenschaften-insb-lern-und-veraenderungsmechanismen/personen/ren-xiangjuan.html) and [Dr. Rani Moran (Queen Mary University of London)](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbbs/staff/rani-moran.html).

### Older Adults Learning from Surprising Events

When we learn about a novel decision-making environment, we are sometimes presented with surprising outcomes which can be (1) outlier events and therefore uninformative or (2) indicative of a change we must adapt to. The ability to distinguish between these two types of surprising outcomes and act (or make decisions) is critical during decision-making. While younger adults seem to be quite skilled at detecting when a surprising outcome requires them to update their representation of the environment, older adults may have deficits in doing so.

The *two* current projects aim to investigate this how older adults learn from surprising outcomes by applying behavioral analyses, computational modeling and electroencephalography (EEG) analyses.

The first project is in collaboration with [Dr. Ben Eppinger (Universit√§t Greifswald)](https://psychologie.uni-greifswald.de/43051/lehrstuehle/entwicklungspsychologie-und-paedagogische-psychologie/benjamin-eppinger/).

The second project is in collaboration with [Zoe Hilker (Max Planck School of Cognition)](https://cognition.maxplanckschools.org/en/doctoral-candidates/zoe-hilker).
